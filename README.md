Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values
Addressing inconsistencies and errors
Data normalization and standardization
Data Transformation:
Creating calculated fields (e.g., air quality index)
Aggregating data to desired levels (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly)
Joining data from multiple sources
Visualization Components
Dashboard Overview:
Summary of key air pollution metrics
Geographic map visualizing pollution levels across cities
Trend Analysis:
