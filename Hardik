Project Overview

This Power BI project aims to visualize air pollution 
data across various cities, providing insights into pollution 
levels, trends, and potential correlations with other factors.
By leveraging Power BI's interactive capabilities, we can create
a dynamic and informative dashboard to support decision-making and 
awareness about air quality.
